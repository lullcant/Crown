# Code Repository for MICCAI 2025 Submission

## Repository Overview

This repository is dedicated to our MICCAI 2025 submission. During the review phase, we are providing the reviewers with the implementation code for our model, tooth label prompt, CMPL loss..., to facilitate a clearer understanding of our methodology. Additionally, we have included sample data for reference. 

However, due to anonymity requirements, we are unable to provide the pretrained model with external link to online drive at this time. If our paper is accepted, we plan to open-source the training and inference code, pretrained model checkpoints etc.
